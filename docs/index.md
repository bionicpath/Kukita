# Welcome to the KukitaBot Docs
This is the official documentation for KukitaBot. This documentation is far from finished and new features will be added constantly, but I'll do my best to update
these as new features are added to the bot!

If you happen to find a bug or an issue with this documentation, feel free to report it [here](https://github.com/sp00p/Kukita/issues)
# Modules 
As of right now the bot is quite lacking when it comes to features, but I have additional plans for modules that should be coming in the near future. 
## Moderation 
KukitaBot can handle any of your moderation needs in your server. Whether it be muting a member, kicking a member from a VC, or kicking/banning a troublemaker
KukitaBot has you covered. This is currently the main module of KukitaBot.
